            <h5>History</h5>
        
            <p>The history of Bhavnagar is deeply intertwined with the Gohil Rajput clan, who migrated from Marwar to the
                coastal areas
                of Gujarat around 1260 AD. Initially, they established capitals at Sejakpur, Umrala, and Sihor. The frequent
                attacks on
                Sihor prompted Maharaja Bhavsinhji to establish a new capital near Vadva village, naming it Bhavnagar. This
                location was
                strategically chosen for its potential in maritime trade, which flourished under his reign and continued to
